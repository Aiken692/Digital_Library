The Digital_Library displays a catalog of all books in the Library.
This digital catalog allows users to: 

   * create a book and its author
   * Search the book and author by Id
   * Update the book and author details
   * Delete the book and the author data

## How it Operates.
  The catalog involves different endpoints that can can be used in postman to request for a paticular command. These are some of the controllers both for the Authors and books:

Different end points are hit in Postman and this enables to carry out a particular command of the Api like getting authors and the books.
